Hello, I’m Eddie Tseng and I’m a Toronto based web developer. Currently, I work full-time at a start up in the staffing industry. Most days, you can find me developing a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

As a graduate from Ryerson University’s entrepreneurship and strategy program, my path to becoming a developer was definitely not a straight forward one. I’ve been lucky enough to have the opportunity to learn in many different (mostly client facing) professional roles.

Past Work:

* IT Contractor - Working in operations and project for corporate mobile deployment/management.
* High Ticket Sales - Building client relationships, rapport, and offering best advice for complex solutions.
* Software Developer - Working in health care tech, helping integrate different electronic medical record systems.

I love connecting with people who are passionate about ideas, problem solving, systems, and technology. If you want to connect, the best place to contact me right now is through <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/eddietseng">Linkedin</a>. Email is the bane of my existence.
