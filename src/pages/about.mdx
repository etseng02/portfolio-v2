Currently I work as a developer 

I am a Toronto based full stack developer. I love solving interesting
problems. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you think I can fit
your needs!

As a graduate from Ryerson University’s entrepreneurship and strategy
program, I’ve always known that creating value, solving problems and
self improvement were things that I’ve always loved doing. Becoming a
developer was a natural extension of those traits. Creating complex
applications, leading teams, and moving projects forward is what I do
best. I’m constantly looking to improve my skills, my thought
technology, and my life.

For me, pushing myself both mentally and physically is incredibly
rewarding. It’s fun to try my best, so when I decide to do something, I
intend to achieve the highest level I can. I’ve pursued a few hobbies
that have allowed me to push myself to the limits such as competitive
badminton and competitive dragon boat. Currently, I’m trying to become
the best that I can be at bouldering (rock climbing without ropes). I’ll
never be satisfied with who I am. I hear a voice in my head telling me I
can do more and I can be better. But for now, this who I currently am.
